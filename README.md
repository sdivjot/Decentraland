**Solidity:** Uses Solidity to write smart contracts that manage property listing, and integrates Open-Zeppelin ERC721 implementation to handle sale, lending, and inspection approval to complete a purchase.

**IPFS:** Used to store media in a decentralized way such as property images.

**Hardhat:** Framework used for building, testing and deploying smart contracts on local blockchain node.

**Mocha and Chai:** Used for smart contract testing and task verification.

**Open-Zeppelin:** Used for their preconfigured implementation of the ERC-721 token, enabling us to perform sale-purchase in NFTs.

## *Client-Side Interface*

**ReactJS:** Utilized for building a dynamic user interface, ensuring a smooth user experience, along with effective communication to the Metamask Chrome Extension.
